## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, feature requests, or bug reports, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

To contribute to **Wordledle**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    `cd YOUR_REPO_NAME`
3. Install dependencies by running:
    `npm install`
    or, if you're using Yarn:
    `yarn install`
4. Set up your local development environment with the necessary configuration. Ensure you have the required tools for React Native development, such as Node.js, npm (or Yarn), and a suitable code editor like Visual Studio Code.
5. Define any required environment variables in a `.env` file if the app uses them. This might include API keys, endpoints, or other configuration settings needed for local development.
6. Start the development server:
    If you're using Expo:
    `npx expo start`
    If you're not using Expo, start the Metro bundler:
    `npx react-native start`
7. Run the app on your emulator or connected device:
    For Android:
    `npx react-native run-android`
    For iOS (macOS only):
    `npx react-native run-ios`
    If using Expo, you can also scan the QR code provided by the Expo CLI with the Expo Go app on your device to see the app running live.
8. Access the application through your emulator or physical device. For non-Expo projects, ensure your emulator is set up properly, or connect a physical device and enable developer mode.
9. Make your changes and ensure they don't break the app. Test thoroughly on both Android and iOS (if applicable).
10. Commit and push your changes to your fork of the repository, then create a pull request with a description of your changes.

Development Tips:
Ensure you have React Native CLI installed for running React Native commands outside Expo.
Keep your environment up to date with the latest versions of Node.js, npm, and React Native tools.
For Expo users, familiarize yourself with the Expo Documentation for smooth development and deployment.
